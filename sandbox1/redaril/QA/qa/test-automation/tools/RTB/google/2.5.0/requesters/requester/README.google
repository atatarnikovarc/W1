This directory contains sample code sent to Ad Exchange Real Time Bidding
partners.  This code allows them to run a simple test against their bidders
as they develop them.

This code is available to partners through the realtime bidding sites page at:
https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/adx-rtb/real-time-bidder-documentation

In order to test the application:
1) Create a tar.gz archive of the necessary files in blaze-genfiles:
blaze build contentads/adx/networkbid/sample/requester:export
2) Unzip the archive to a standalone directory
   (creates a sub-directory named 'requester'):
tar -xz -f blaze-genfiles/contentads/adx/networkbid/sample/requester/requester.tar.gz -C ~/
cd ~/requester
3) Build the proto Python wrapper:
make
4) Run unit tests:
make test
5) Follow the instructions in the README file to run the application:
less README
6) For a hacky sanity test (ALERT: see NOTE below), run:
python requester.py  --url=https://httpbin.org/post --max_qps=1 --requests=1
It will fail with "Unparseable bid response", and you will be able to see the
bid request that was sent in the invalid-* log that the application has
generated.
NOTE: This hack bounces the bid request off a public third-party server (see
docs at http://httpbin.org ); NEVER use this if the bid request contains
non-random data (e.g. you are using the --google_user_ids_file parameter)
