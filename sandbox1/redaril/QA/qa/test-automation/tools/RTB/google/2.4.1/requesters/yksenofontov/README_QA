sendRequest.sh - sends a request to google/api
sendSnippetToMe.sh - sends a snippet file to user(ip into) using scp
probability.py - performs requests, gather statistics

Requirements to have Requester <--> RA Google RTB interaction working
(i.e. RA Google RTB responds with a snippet to show AD):

1. Pacing manager - PM_ALLOCATON table contains proper records for a campaign
2. if no USER MODEL, then a campaign shouldn't be 'Retargeting'
3. servlet.google.timeout = 2000
4. rtb.response.time.threshold=5000
5. the campaing is running 
6. The protocol fields is_ping, is_test, experimental_deadline are set to false
(see generator.py)

**NOTES:

1. Some times RA Google RTB doesn't respond with a snippet, googleintegration.log contains:
-No available pacing data in RTB, default will be sent
-No enough time to process
it is just connection issues - google rtb can't connect to pacing manager

**HOW TO

1. New realtime-bidding.proto file
--put it to /home/csc/QA/RTB/google/2.4.1/distr/protobuf-2.4.1 (**)
--run "protoc -I=. --python_out=. realtime-bidding.proto" from (**) folder
--put realtime_bidding_pb2.py to all necessary requesters(requester, atatarnikov, yksenofontov, ...)
