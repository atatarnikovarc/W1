Rme - Remote Executor

It is used on unix starts a daemon which listens to port 7050

It was created like auxiliary tool to simplify future work with remote ssh clients/console/computers
Connected to this port and passed authorization it is possible to send any bash command
And it will be executed on the computer where Rme is running
Answer will be written to a socket(all stdout from command executions) as the result 


NOTE:
Please be careful,
Also don't abuse the application,
becase at the remote machine the command specified by you will be executed without restrictions


example how to use:
connect to socket:
	use ip of computer and port 7050
		step 1:
			send to socket: rme 1.0
			you will receive: rme 1.0 OK
		step 2:
			send to socket: auth_username rmeClient
			you will receive: auth_username rmeClient OK
		step 3:
			now you can
			send command to socket: sqlplus qacluster4_meta/qacluster4_meta@10.50.150.90:1521/qacluster @/root/QA/test.sql
			you will receive:
